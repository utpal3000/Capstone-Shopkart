`FYND Captsone Project`

## Ecommerce Website Using React

The project requires creating a fully functional, responsive frontend using React and integrating with a backend for product and cart management.

**Project Overview**

E-commerce website using MERN. The project requires creating a fully functional, responsive frontend using React and integrating with a backend for product and cart management. 
Core features include product browsing, cart management, and order placement. The website will be evaluated based on UI design, functionality, and code structure.


### Overall Breakdown

1. Project Setup and Initial Frontend Development

  Set up the project repository on GitHub.
  Create the basic project structure using React.
  Design main pages Home, Product, and Cart, using HTML and CSS.
  Ensure responsiveness using CSS or Bootstrap.
  Implement navigation components (e.g., Home, Products, Cart).

2. Backend Setup and API Integration

Set up a backend (optional or using a third-party API like Fakestore API).
Create mock data for products using JSON or connect to an external API.
Implement product fetching from the API.
Display the fetched products on the frontend with dynamic rendering.

3. Cart Management System

Implement add-to-cart functionality.
Display selected items in the cart with quantities.
Allow users to modify cart items (update quantity, remove items).
Calculate and display total price dynamically.

4. Order Placement and User Interaction

Implement an order form where users enter details (e.g., name, address, phone number).
Handle form validation and ensure all required fields are filled.
Display a success message upon order completion.
Clear the cart after a successful order.

5. Project Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

Test the entire workflow (product listing, cart, and order placement).
Fix any issues and optimize performance.
Write documentation with setup instructions.
Deploy the app on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a similar platform.

Key Functionalities

Browse products with a dynamic listing.
Add products to the cart and adjust quantities.
2. Cart Management :
Display cart details with total price calculations.
Remove items and proceed to checkout.
3. Order Placement :
