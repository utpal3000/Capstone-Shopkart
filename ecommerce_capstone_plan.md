## Daily Time Management Tips

### For Working Professionals:
- **Early Morning (2-3 hours)**: Before work, focus on complex logic
- **Lunch Break (1 hour)**: Quick fixes, testing, or documentation
- **Evening (4-5 hours)**: Main development work
- **Weekend**: Catch up and polish

### Productivity Tips:
1. Use Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break)
2. Commit code frequently with meaningful messages
3. Test features immediately after implementation
4. Keep a daily progress log
5. Use browser dev tools for debugging
6. Have backup plans for major roadblocks

## Essential Resources

### Quick References:
- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Express.js Guide](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB/Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/)

### Tools:
- **Design**: Figma/Canva for quick mockups
- **API Testing**: Postman or Thunder Client
- **Database**: MongoDB Compass for database management
- **Icons**: Lucide React or Heroicons
- **Images**: Unsplash for product images

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

1. **Time Constraints**: Focus on MVP first, add enhancements later
2. **API Integration Issues**: Always have fallback/mock data ready
3. **Styling Challenges**: Use Tailwind UI components as reference
4. **Deployment Issues**: Test deployment early (Day 6-7)
5. **State Management Complexity**: Keep state structure simple

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All core features working
- [ ] Responsive on mobile and desktop
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Fast loading times (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Successful deployment
- [ ] Clean, readable code
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Emergency Backup Plan
If running behind schedule:
- Use Fake Store API instead of custom backend
- Focus on frontend excellence
- Simplify authentication (optional login)
- Use localStorage for cart persistence
- Deploy static site with mock data

Remember: It's better to have a fully functional simple application than a complex application with bugs. Focus on completing the MVP first, then add enhancements.
